Intellitrade
------------

System Description :
--------------------

Intellitrade is an automated algorithmic trading system designed to execute predefined trading strategies at fixed time intervals. The system evaluates market conditions and current order states, and automatically places or skips trades based on strategy logic and risk rules.

The primary goal of Intellitrade is to provide a reliable, modular, and cloud-native trading engine that can be extended from simple scheduled strategies to more advanced automated trading workflows.


Core Functionality :
--------------------

Intellitrade operates in a scheduled execution cycle:

1. Scheduled Trigger
    The system is triggered at a fixed interval (e.g., every 10 minutes) using a cloud scheduler.

2. Market & Order Data Fetching

On each execution, Intellitrade retrieves:
    Current market prices from the broker’s REST API
    Existing order and position status from the broker
    Strategy state and historical order data from persistent storage

3. Strategy Evaluation

Trading strategies are evaluated using the latest market data and current positions. Strategy determines whether to:
    Place a new order
    Modify or exit an existing position
    Take no action

4. Order Execution
    If strategy conditions are satisfied and risk checks pass, Intellitrade places orders through the broker API. All executions are designed to be idempotent to prevent duplicate trades.

5. State & Ledger Update
    After execution, the system updates Order history
    These records are stored persistently for consistency and auditability.

6. Logging & Monitoring
    Each execution cycle is fully logged, including “no-action” decisions, enabling traceability, debugging, and performance analysis.


Architecture Overview :
    Execution Model         :   Event-driven, interval-based automation
    Compute                 :   AWS Lambda (MVP)
    Scheduling              :   Amazon EventBridge
    Broker Integration      :   Broker APIs
    State Storage           :   S3
    Logging & Monitoring    :   Amazon CloudWatch


The system is intentionally designed to be stateless at runtime, with all critical state persisted externally. This ensures reliability, fault tolerance, and easy scalability.


Design Principles :
    Idempotent Order Handling       –   Prevents duplicate or unintended trades
    Cloud-Native & Cost-Efficient   –   Uses serverless infrastructure for early-stage deployment
    Safety First                    –   Emphasis on controlled execution, observability, and risk awareness
