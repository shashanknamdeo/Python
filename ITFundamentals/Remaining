Backend Engineer Requirements
1. Programming Languages
    A backend engineer must be strong in at least one server-side language:
    Python (Django, Flask) ✅ Good for you
    Java (Spring Boot)
    JavaScript (Node.js)
    Go, Ruby, PHP (depending on company)
    👉 For you: Focus on Python + Django since you’re already using it.

2. Understanding of APIs
    Backend engineers build APIs to connect frontend and database.
    Must know:
        RESTful APIs
        HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
        JSON format
        Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
    📌 Interview tip:
        “I have experience designing RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework.”

3. Database Knowledge
    Backend systems store and retrieve data efficiently.
    Required:
        SQL databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
        NoSQL: MongoDB (optional but good)
        Writing queries & joins
        Database design & normalization

4. Server & Hosting Knowledge
    Understanding how backend runs in production.
    Important concepts:
        Linux basics
        AWS / Cloud deployment ☁️ (You are preparing for AWS — great advantage)
        Docker (bonus skill)
        Nginx / Gunicorn

5. Data Structures & Algorithms
    Companies test problem-solving ability.
    Must know:
        Arrays, Linked Lists
        Stacks, Queues
        Trees, Graphs
        Time complexity (Big-O)

6. Version Control
    Collaboration requires Git.
    Required:
        Git basics
        GitHub workflows
        Pull requests & branching

7. Security Basics
    Backend engineers protect data.
    Concepts:
        Authentication & Authorization
        Password hashing (bcrypt)
        HTTPS & encryption
        Preventing SQL injection & XSS

8. System Design Basics (for growth)
    Even freshers should know basics:
        Client–server architecture
        Load balancing
        Caching (Redis)
        Microservices vs Monolith
