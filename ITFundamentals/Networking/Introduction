router - routes the data packet to ip addresses

surver - client

NAT - Network Address Translation

IP adrees - global and local - IP address identifies the devices 

Port numbers -  identifies the appication. it is a 16 bit numbers
    ports number = 2^16 around 65,000
    0-1023      reserve ports (like HTTP)
    1024-around 49152       reserve for application (like SQL, MongoDB)
    remaining we can use

switch: Switches connect multiple devices within the same network, allowing them to communicate with each other.

router: Routers act as a gateway, connecting your local network to other networks, like the internet
        Routers often provide security features like firewalls to protect your network.

# structure of networks

OSI model - Open Systems Interconnection (more conceptual)

Application layer   -   contains software
Presentation layer  -   translaion(charater - machine representable binary format), encription, encoding, abstraction, compressed, SSL protocol
Session layer       -   authantiction, authoristion, section creation
Transport layer     -   chunks, segmentation (ports number, sequence number, flow comtrol, eror control) checksome(TCP, UDP)
Network layer       -   routers, assign ip address, smallest path, load balancing
Data layer Link     -   add mack adress
Physical layer      -   cables or optical wire


TCP/IP model - Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (more practical)

Application layer       -   Supports protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP     (normally Presentation and Session layer comes in this layer )
Transport layer         -   Reliable communication using TCP or UDP
Internet layer          -   Handles logical addressing, routing (IP)
Network Access layer    -   Deals with physical transmission and hardware (Ethernet, MAC)


------------------------------------------------------

1. Application layer - on your devices (user intract, whatsapp, browser ), protocols, client - server architecture

client - server architecture
p2p architectre - every computer serves as client as well as surver

repeater
hub - active and passive hub
bridge - transparent and source routing bridge
switch
router
brouter
gateway


TCP/IP 
    HTTP
    DHCP
    FTP
    SMTP - for send emai
    POP3 / IMAC - for recieve email
    SSH
    VNC
TELNET : port 23
UDP : stateless connection


program -> process -> thread

socket - interface between process and internet

ports -> epharmals ports


HTTP:
    HTTP is a application layer protocol
    HTTP uses TCP as transport layer
    HTTP is a stateless protocol (server is not store any information about client)

HTTP methord:
    POST
    GET
    PUT
    DELETE

Status codes
    100=199 : Informational purpose
    200-299 : success purpose
    300-399 : redirection purpose
    400-499 : client error purpose
    500-599 : server error purpose

Cookie
    cookies are string stored in client browser by the website to make browsing smother
    it saves information like Login info, User preferences, Shopping cart data, etc

Third-Party Cookies : Set by another domain that is not the website you are visiting.


Email:
    application layer : 
        1. SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol)
        2. POP3 (Post office protocol)
        3. IMAP (internet Mail Access Protocol)
    transport layer : TCP

    sender -> sender's SMTP server -> receiver's SMTP server -> receiver

DNS (Domain name system):
    website name -> IP address
    sub-domain
    second level domain
    top level domain
        exampla : mil.google.com -> mail (sub-domain), google (second level domain), com (top level domain)
    if client want to find IP address for name
        -> clent first search it in browser cache
        -> then local DNS (ex : internet service provider)
        -> then in root server
        -> then in top level domain (have all ip address)

we can only rent a domain, can't buy it

------------------------------------------------------

2. Transport layer

network layer transfers data from 1 divece to another while transport layar transfers data from network to application

transport layer mutiplex and demultiplex : these are use to manage which data is trnsfer to which application using sockit port number

transport also take care about trafic congestion control

cheacksome : a perticular string/value which is use to cheak that all data is recieved or not
    cheacksome is calulated in sender device and send with data then reciever also calculate cheacksome and equate it

timer : when sender send data a timer is start and terminate when reciver responce is get else if timer time is out it will sent same packit again

UDP (user datagram protocol)
        data may or may not be delevered
        data may change 
        data may not be oredr
        udp uses checksome but not do anything with it
        connection less
    UDP packet : it has header (sender port no. , reciever port no. , length of data dram , cheacksome) and data
    UPD use cases :
        fast
        gaming
        video confrensing
        dns

TCP(transport layer protocol)
    when application layer send data it segments the data (divide in chunks, add header)
    congestion control
    takes care when data not arrive
    maintains the order of data
    features:
        connection orented (first a connection is to establish)
        error control
        congection control
        fuel duplex (A can sends to B, B can send to A, or both can send simultaniously)
        1 TCP connection can be only between two devices
        3 ways heand shake
            1) A send sync flag to B
            2) then B send acknowledgement to A
            3) then A send acknowledgement to B

------------------------------------------------------

3. Network layer:
    router is here
    network layer tranports packet
    control plane
    in 128.0.3.1 -> 128.0.3 is network address and .1 is divice address
    IP (internet protocol) - IPV4, IPV6
    hop by hop forwarding (use algo like dijktra algo to find shortest path)
    routing
        static routing
        dynamic routing

------------------------------------------------------

4. Datalink layer:
    DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol) is use to give local IP address
    Datalink layer tranports frames

middle box -> fire walls, NAT
