IAM (IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT):


IAM - Global service
creation of user, roles and groups
give permition to user, roles and groups


Policies Hands On
    Add and remove permision to user group
    see and create policy

policies (use to give permisions)
    Add and create pasword policy
    Multi factor authanthicator

MFA (Multi factor authanthicator)
    Virtual MFA device - Google Authenticator
    Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key - YubiKey by Yubico (3rd party)
    Hardware Key Fob MFA Device - Provided by Gemalto (3rd party)
    Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud (US) - Provided by SurePassID (3rd party)


ways to access AWS
    aws management console (using passward + multi factor authorisation)
    command line (using access key)
    AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) - API call

access key id ~= user name
secret access key ~= passward

AWS CLI(command line interface) version 2 download:
(Name)top-right-corner -> security credentials -> Access keys -> create Access keys

IAM roles for service
    (some services need to perform action on our behalf. this can be done by assigning a role to service and give permision to role)
    ex:
        EC2 instance role
        lambda function role
        role for cloud formation
    create EC2 role: IAM -> Roles -> create roles -> AWS service -> EC2 -> IAMReadOnlyAccess -> give name -> create role


IAM security tools
    IMA credential report (give info like when was pasward last use/create/MFA etc)
        IAM -> crediantial report -> download crediential report
    IAM access advisor (give info about when was the  permission last used)
        IAM -> User -> user name -> Access advisor(last access)


IAM Guidelines & Best Practices

Shared Responsibility Model for IAM

_______________________________________________________________________________

-------------------------------------------------------------------- Lacture 34

AWS budget setup:
    To Activate IAM user access to billing info: 
        Navigate: (Name)top-right-corner -> account -> scrol down -> IAM user and role access to Billing information 
    To create budget:
        Navigate: (Name)top-right-corner -> billing and cost management -> budget -> create budget
        or Navigate: (Name)top-right-corner -> account -> scrol left menu -> budget -> create budget

EC2 (ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD):
    EC2 user data: use to bootstrap our instance (bootstrap means launch command when machine start first)
    ec2 instance types
    launch EC2 instance: EC2 -> launch instance -> (name, key pair, SSH amd HTTP, advance details -> user date (paste EC2 code given))
    EC2 instance type: 
        types :      https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
        comparision: https://instances.vantage.sh/
        IMP types
        1) general purpose
        2) compute optimised
        3) memory optimised
        4) storage optimised


security groups:
    use as a firewall for instance (allow and deny, inbond and outbond of data)
    can refer other sequrity group (means allow data come or go to other other secqurity group)
    Security groups only contain 'allow' rules
    security groups Locked down to a region / VPC combination
    By default - All inbound traffic is BLOCKED and All outbound traffic is AUTHORISED

classic ports:
    22   - SSH      (Secure Shell) - log into linux instance
    21   - FTP      (File Transfer Protocol)
    22   - SFTP     (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
    80   - HTTP     
    443  - HTTPS    
    3389 - RDP      (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into windows instance

NOTE - if we see a timeout on browser while connecting to EC2 instance. it is because of sequrity group

-------------------------------------------------------------------- Lacture 40

SSH (Secure Shell) is used in EC2 to securely connect to your virtual machine (instance) from your local computer.

Use case - we can do many thing with SSH connection like install python and django etc

SSH - MAC /Linux /Windows >= 10
putty - windows (all version)
EC2 instance connect - all OS

SSH using linus/mac

SSH using putty

SSH using windows
    navigate cmd to location where we has sequrity key -> ssh -i EC2-Key_pair.pem ec2-user@65.0.122.198
        where "EC2-Key_pair.pem" is sequrity key file name and "65.0.122.198" is the public ip adress get by instance


connect using EC2 instant connect (in browser)
    navigate to instanes -> select instance and click connect option -> scrol down and click connect

connect IAM role to EC2 instance
    navigate to instanes -> select instance and click actions -> sequrity -> Modify IAM user -> select IAM role -> Update IAM role

EC2 instances purchasing options:
    On demand
    Spot instance - short workloads, cheap, can loss instance (less reliable)
    Capacity reservation - reserve capicity in a spacific AZ for any duration (GUARANTEE that you'll get an instance.)
    Reserve instance (1 and 3 year comitment) - NOT GUARANTEE that you'll get an instance.
        Standard RI - Less flexible   Higher Discout
        Convertible RI - More flexible   Lower Discout
    Saving plan - comitment of a amount of usage, workload
    Dedicated host - book a entire physical server
    Dedicated instance - no other cx will share your hardware


| Feature                | Reserved Instance       | Dedicated Instance           | Capacity Reservation         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------  | --------------------------   | --------------------------   |
| **Main Use**           | Save money              | Isolation on physical host   | Reserve compute capacity     |
| **Billing Impact**     | Discounted hourly rate  | On-Demand pricing            | Pay regardless of use        |
| **Hardware Isolation** | ❌ Shared               | ✅ Dedicated                | ❌ Shared (unless combined) |
| **Capacity Guarantee** | ❌ No                   | ✅ (dedicated hardware)     | ✅ Yes                      |
| **Time Commitment**    | ✅ 1 or 3 years         | ❌ No commitment            | ❌ No commitment            |


IPAM (IP address management)
    search IPAM -> open VPC IPAM -> create IPAM -> allow data replication, add all reagion -> create IPAM

EC2 INSTANCE STORAGE SELECTION


EBS (Elastic block storage) volume: (thinks it as a USB storage device that can be connected over network)
    use to persist the data even after termination of EC2 instance
    1 EBS volume can be attached to only one instance (at certified cloud practioner level)
    1 EBS volume is fixed to that availablity zone
    1 instance have many EBS volume attached to it

create volume:
EC2 -> slide left menu and click volume -> create volume -> Select GP2, 1GiB, avilablity zone(same as instance) -> create volume

Note: create volume with avilablity zone(same as instance) is IMPORTANT to attach this volume to instance

Attach Volume:
EC2 -> slide left menu and click volume -> select volume -> attach volume -> choose instance and name -> attach volume

EBS snapshort:
    use to make a backup(snapshort /copy) of EBS volume at a point of time
    take snapshort after detaching with instance is best practice

EBS snapshort advantage:
    can make a copy of volume in another reagion /availablity zone and attach it to another instance
    can archive volume state at a point of time
    can setup Recycle bin for snapshort
    can Archive SS (Restoration take 24 - 72 hours)

EBS snapshort creation:
    EC2 -> slide left menu and click volume -> create snapshort -> add discription and create Snapshort

EBS snapshort location:
    EC2 -> slide left menu and click snapshort

EBS snapshort copy to another region:
    SS -> select SS -> actions -> copy SS -> add description and select region and copy SS

EBS volume creation to another region:
    snapshort -> select SS -> action -> create volume from SS -> add volume type, size, availablity zone -> create volume

EBS snapshort archive:(75% less price)(to restore from archive we have to wait for 24-72 hours)
    snapshort -> select SS -> action -> archiving -> archive SS

EBS snapshort recycle bin:
    SS -> recycle bin -> set up retantion rules
    SS -> select SS -> delete SS (move to recycle bin)
    restore SS: SS -> recycle bin -> select SS -> recover

AMI (Amazon Machine Image):

AMI is the customization of an EC2 instance (think it as a image / copy of EC2 instance)
In AMI we can add our own OS / software / sequrity etc
Faster boot / configure time because all softwares are pre-packed

AMI can be copied to another reagion

we can make a EC2 instance using
    A public AMI : amazon provide
    own AMI: which is buit by our own
    AWS marketplace AMI: make by other (for selling purpose)

AMI process (from an EC2 instance):
    Start an EC2 instance and customise it
    Stop instance
    Make AMI - this will also create EBS snapshort
    Launch instances from AMI

AMI creation:
    launch new ec2 instance:
        Key pair (login) - select key pairs
        Network settings - Select existing security group -> add security groups in Common security groups
        Advanced details -> user data -> copy - paste all code given except last line 'echo .......... html'
        launch instance
        open public IPv4 using HTTP
        if it show 'It works!' means all good
    create AMI:
        select on create instance -> actions -> image and templates -> create image -> write image name and click create image
    launch instance with AMI:
        Way - 1 
            Name and tags -> give name
        way - 2
            instance -> launch insance
            Name and tags -> give name
            Application and OS Images -> My AMIs -> owned by me -> select AMI in Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
        Key pair (login) - select key pairs
        Network settings - Select existing security group -> add security groups in Common security groups
        Advanced details -> user data -> copy - paste code
            '
            #!/bin/bash
            # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
            # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
            echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
            '
        launch instance
        open public IPv4 using HTTP
        if it show 'Hello world' means all good


EC2 Image Builder:
    use to automate creation, manage, validate and test of EC2 AMIs (vertual machines / container Images)


EC2 Instance Store: (Ephemeral storage):
    EBS are good but limited performance
    EC2 instance store has high performance
    better I/O performance
    if we stop or terminate EC2 instance than the EC2 instance store attached to it will lose all data 
    good for cache, buffer, temporary data, scratch data

EFS (Elastic File System):
    It is another type of storage
    100s of EC2 instances access EFS at the same time
    work only on linux EC2 instance
    work with any availablity zone in a region
    highly available, scalable, expensive
    pay on storage not capicity planning
    EFS-IA (EFS infrequent access):
        lower in cost than EFS
        automatic move data which is not frequently use to EFS-IA with a lifecycle policy
        automatic move data from EFS-IA if call by instance

Shared responsiblity model for EC2 storage:
    AWS responsiblity:
    user responsiblity:
        backup / Snapshort procedure
        encription
        responsiblity any data on disk
        etc.

Amazon FSx :
    third party high performance file system on AWS
    FSx Lusture: (drived from "Linux" and "cluster")
        linux based
        use for high performance computation
        millions IOPS (Input Output Operation per Second) and 100s GB per second
        task - ML, video processing, analitics etc
    FSx Windows:
        windows native
        connect to Windows instances and Windows infrastructure easily
    etc.

ELB and ASG Section :

Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling Group

Scalablity:
    vertical scalablity - increase the size of instance (t2.micro to t2.large)
    horizontal scalablity (elasticity) - increase the no. of instance (10 instance to 20 instance)
        load balancer
        auto scale group

High availablity:
    run application on atleast 2 AZ (availablity zones) to avoide system down due to any disaster
    load balancer multi AZ
    auto scale group multi AZ

scalablity vs elasticity vs agility (IMP)

Load balancer:
    they are server that forward internet trafic to multiple server (EC2 instances) down stream
    give a single point of access (DNS) to application
    handle failure in down stream
    perform regular health cheacks to instances
    enable SSL (secure socket layer) termination like HTTPS to website
    High availablity accros zone

ELB:
    Elastic load balancer is  load balancer provided by AWS
    Type of EBS
        Aplication LB - layer 7 - HTTP / HTTPS / gRPC

AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):

S3:
    it advertise as 'infinately storage' service
    use case:
        back up and recovery
        archive
        hybrid cloud
        application hosting
        media hosting
        data lake and big data analysis
        software dilavery
        static website


S3 store files (object) in directory (buckets):
    buckets (directory):
        grobally unique name
        S3 looks like a global service but buckets defined at regional level
    Object (files):
        object has key (key = full path)
        ex - s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt
        key = prefix (ex - my_folder/another_folder) + object name (ex - my_file.txt)
    object value = content of object
    max object size = 5 TB
    if file size > 5 GB, it must be upload in multi-part

Note - there is no concept of directory in buckets


Create bucket:
    go to S3 service
    click create bucket, give name, and click create bucket

upload files (object):
    in bucket click upload
    add file want to upload
    click upload

see files:
    click on file (object) name
    click on open
    Note - can't open by Object URL because file is private


S3 Security:
    User based
        IAM permision
    Resource based
        Bucket policy - cross accout permision
        Object access control list
        Bucket access control list

Note - An IAM principal can access S3 object if IAM permition allow or RESOURCE POLICY allows and there is NO EXPLICIT DENY

EC2 can access S3 using IAM roles

S3 bucket policy:
    JSON based policy
    use S3 bucket for policy
        cross account access
        public access

Bucket setting for block public access - developed by AWS

Available an AWS bucket publically:
    Go to bucket and click permision
    Block public access - edit - Block all public access - untick
    Bucket policy - edit - copy Bucket ARN and policy generator
    Type of Policy - S3 Bucket Policy
    Add statement(s)
        Effect - allow
        Principal - *(means any one can access)
        Actions - GetObject
        Amazon Resource Name (ARN) - paste copy Bucket ARN and add '/*' at last (everthing in bucket)
        Click generate policy and copy json code
    Back to Bucket policy - paste json code and click 'save changes' at last
    Now anyting in bucket can be access publically


AWS - Static Website Hosting

Create Static website:
    Make sure that 'coffee' image and index.htlm in bucket
    In bucket click on 'property' than click on edit in 'Static website hosting'
    Static website hosting - click enable
    Index document - enter 'index.html'
    In bucket click on 'property' than click on url in 'Static website hosting'


S3 versioning:
    Enable it at bucket lavel
    Any file which is not version in past has version 'null'
    After enable versoning, if delete a file this only create a DELETE MARKER on file 

Use S3 versioning:
    Go to bucket - property - Bucket Versioning - edit - enable - Save changes


S3 - replication
    Types:
        CRR - cross region replication
        SRR - same region replication
    must enable versoning
    give proper IAM permision to S3

create replication:
    create atleast 2 bucket in different or same reagion with versioning enable
    go to bucket which want to replicate and open management
    Replication rules - create rules
    Replication rule configuration - Replication rule name - enter name
    Source bucket - tick 'Apply to all objects in the bucket'
    Destination - enter target bucket name
    IAM role - create new role
    save - submit

AWS DATABASE:

sheared responsiblity model for database


RDS (Relational database service): FREE TIER
    It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
    Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
    Automated provisioning, OS patching
    Continuous backups
    Monitoring dashboards
    Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
    Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)

-> Load balancer <-> instances <-> RDS

Amazon aurora: (NOT IN THE FREE TIER)
    Aurora is “AWS Cloud Optimized” Relational Database
    Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
    PostgreSQL and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB
    claims performance improvement over MySQL and Postgres on RDS
    Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 128 TB
    Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) – but is more efficient

Amazon Aurora Serverless:
    On-demand auto-scaling version of Aurora
    Least management overhead 
    Pay per second, can be more cost effective for New apps, prototypes, infrequent usage
    Use cases: good for infrequent or unpredictableworkloads

RDS creation:
    search and open aurora and RDS - create Database

Other Compute Service

Docker:
    Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
    Apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS
    Apps run the same, regardless of where they’re run
    docker repository:
        Public: Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/ 
        Private: Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
    Docker is ”sort of” a virtualization technology, but not exactly


ECS (Elastic Container Service):
    Launch Docker containers on AWS
    You MUST provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
    AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers

Fargate :
    Serverless offering
    Launch Docker containers on AWS
    You DO NOT provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage) – simpler!
    AWS just runs containers for you based on the CPU / RAM you need

ECR (Elastic Container Registry):
    Elastic Container Registry 
    Private Docker Registry on AWS
    This is where you store your Docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate

EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):
    Kubernetes is an open-source system for management, deployment, and scaling of containerized apps (Docker)
    Allows you to launch managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS
    Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic (can be used in any cloud – Azure, GCP…)

Serverless :
    Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don’t have to manage servers anymore…
    developers just deploy code / deploy functions
    Serverless was start by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that’s managed: “databases, messaging, storage, etc.”
    Serverless does not mean there are no servers… it means you just don’t manage / provision / see them


AWS Lambda:

why use AWS lambda
    Virtual functions – no servers to manage!
    Limited by time - short executions
    Run on-demand
    Scaling is automated!

Benefits of AWS Lambda
    EASY PRICING: Pay per request / call and compute time
        Free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time
    EVENT-DRIVEN: functions get invoked (Trigger) by AWS Service when needed
    Integrated with many programming languages {Node.js (JavaScript), Python, Java, Ruby, Custom Runtime API}
    Invocation time is 15 Minutes

Lambda Container Image 

pricing information here: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/

create lambda function :
    create function
    Author from scratch
    Basic information - name function, select code language
    Change default execution role - 'Use an existing role' (if exist) otherwise select 'Create a role with basic'
    create function

edit function in 'code' and click 'deploy code' to save
test code in 'test' with edit input in 'json' at bottom

    Batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS

Batch vs Lambda 
    Lambda: 
        Time limit 
        Limited runtimes 
        Limited temporary disk space 
        Serverless 
    Batch: 
        No time limit 
        Any runtime as long as it’s packaged as a Docker image 
        Rely on EBS / instance store for disk space 
        Relies on EC2 (can be managed by AWS)

    CloudFormation creates declared Infra, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

Benefits of AWS CloudFormation
    Cost:
        You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
        In Dev, you could automation deletion and recreated (according to time)
    Infrastructure as code
    Productivity
    Supports (almost) all AWS resources:

create CloudFormation stack:
    set ragion as US-east-1 (due to downloaded code)
    create stack
    Specify template - Upload a template file - choose file
    choose '1-ec2-with-sg-eip.yaml' in given code
    enter 'Stack name' and 'SecurityGroupDescription'
    click 'submit' at last

delete CloudFormation stack will delete all the resource allocate to it.

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK):
    Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language: (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET)
    The code is “compiled” into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
    You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
        Great for Lambda functions
        Great for Docker containers in ECS / EKS

AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    Beanstalk = PLATFORM AS A SERVICE (PaaS) 
    Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS (use EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc…)
    Support for many platforms (including python)
    Three architecture models: 
        Single Instance deployment: good for dev 
        LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications 
        ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers, etc..)

    To deploy our application automatically EC2 INSTANCES and ON-PREMISES SERVERS (HYBRID SERVICE)
    CodeDeploy is use to upgrade code in AWS and on-premise from one version to another version
    Instances / server must be provisioned and configured with the CodeDeploy agent before deployment
    This ensures the agent is ready to receive and execute deployment instructions from CodeDeploy.

CodeCommit – Important – Deprecation
    On July 25th 2024, AWS abruptly discontinued CodeCommit
    AWS recommends to migrate to an external Git solution 3rd party
    For this course:
    CodeCommit might still appear at the exam (for now)

AWS Global Infrastructure

A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
On AWS: this could be Regions and / or Edge Locations

Regions
Availablity zones
edge location (point of presence)

Why make a global application?
    Decreased Latency and better experience
    Disaster Recovery (DR)
    Attack protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack

Amazon Route 53
    Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)

Route 53 Routing Policies
    SIMPLE ROUTING POLICY (No health checks)
    WEIGHTED ROUTING POLICY
    LATENCY ROUTING POLICY

    WaveLength Zones are infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications providers’ datacenters 
    Brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G networks (which enable Ultra-low latency applications)
    Traffic doesn’t leave the Communication Service Provider’s (CSP) network
    Use cases: Smart Cities, ML-assisted diagnostics, Connected Vehicles, Interactive Live Video Streams, AR/VR, 

AWS Local Zones - Extension of an AWS Region
    to run latency-sensitive applications
    Places AWS compute, storage, database, and other selected AWS services closer to end users 
    Compatible with EC2, RDS, ECS, EBS, ElastiCache, Direct Connect

Global Applications Architecture:

    Single Region - Single AZ

        Global Latency  - high
        Difficulty      - low

    Single Region - Multi AZ
        Availability    - higher than Single AZ
        Global Latency  - lower than Single AZ
        Difficulty      - higher than Single AZ

    Multi Region, Active-Passive (read from multiple AZ but write to only one AZ)
        Availability    - higher than Single Region
        Global Latency  - lower than Single Region
        Difficulty      - higher than Single Region

    Multi Region, Active-Active (real and write to all AZ)
        Availability    - higest
        Global Latency  - lowest
        Difficulty      - higest

Cloud Integration Section

When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another

There are two patterns of application communication
1) Synchronous communications (application to application)
2) Asynchronous / Event based (application to queue to application)

Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic
    In that case, it’s better to decouple your applications: (Make Asynchronous)
        using SQS: queue model
        using SNS: pub/sub model
        using Kinesis: real-time data streaming model


Amazon SQS – Simple Queue Service
    Fully managed service (~serverless), use to decouple applications
    Messages are deleted after they’re read by consumers
    Consumers share the work to read messages & scale horizontally
    No limit of massages in queue, Low latency, Scalable, Default retention of messages
    SQS Queue type:
        Standard Queue
        FIFO Queue

SQS Hands on

Amazon SNS - Simple Notification Service
    The “event publishers” only sends message to one SNS topic
    As many “event subscribers” as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications
    Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages
    SNS -> SQS Lambda, Amazon Data Firehose, HTTP(S) Endpoints, SMS & Mobile Notifications, Emails

SNS Hands on


Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
    Managed service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale
    low latency streaming to collect and import data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources
    Amazon Data Firehose: 
        load Kinesis Data Streams into Amazon S3, Redshift, OpenSearch, etc…

Amazon MQ
    Traditional applications running from on-premises may use protocols like: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
    When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use AWS MQ
    Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ
    Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS) but cant scale like SQS / SNS

IP Addresses in AWS
    IPv4 – Internet Protocol version 4 (4.3 Billion Addresses)
        Public IPv4 – can be used on the Internet (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
        EC2 instance gets a new a public IP address every time you stop then start it (default)
        Private IPv4 – can be used on private networks (LAN) such as internal AWS networking 
        Private IPv4 is fixed for EC2 Instances even if you start/stop them
        ELASTIC IP – allows you to attach a FIXED PUBLIC IPv4 address to EC2 instance
        Note: all public IPv4 on AWS will be charged $0.005 per hour (including EIP)
            Free Tier: 750 hours usage per month
    IPv6 – Internet Protocol version 6 (3.4 × 10!" Addresses) (FREE)
        Every IPv6 address is public in AWS (no private range)
        Example: 2001:db8:3333:4444:cccc:dddd:eeee:ffff

VPC & Subnets
    VPC - Virtual Private Cloud: private network to deploy your resources (at regional level)
    SUBNETS allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (at AZ level)
        PUBLIC subnet - subnet that is accessible from the internet
        PRIVATE subnet - subnet that is not accessible from the internet
    To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables

Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways
    Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the internet
        Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
    NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed)
        allow your instances in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private

VPC Hands On

Network ACL & Security Groups
    NACL ( Network Access Control List ) (at the Subnet level)
        A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet 
        have ALLOW and DENY rules
        Rules only include IP addresses
    Security Groups (EC2 Instance level)
        A firewall that controls traffic to and from an EC2 Instance
        have only ALLOW rules
        Rules include IP addresses and other security groups

VPC Flow Logs
    Use to collect the info about trafic through VPC and under VPC
    Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
        VPC Flow Logs
        Subnet Flow Logs
        Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
    Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues
    Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, etc
    VPC Flow logs data can go to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Amazon Data Firehose

VPC Peering 
    Connect two VPC, privately using AWS’ network and Make them behave as if they were in the same network
    Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
    must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another

VPC Endpoints
    Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
    This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
    VPC ENDPOINT GATEWAY: only for S3 & DynamoDB
    VPC ENDPOINT INTERFACE: most services (including S3 & DynamoDB)

AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services)
    Most secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s of VPCs
    Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables…
    Requires a network load balancer at Service VPC and Elastic Network Interface (ENI) at Customer VPC

Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
    Site to Site VPN
        Connect an on-premises to AWS with VPN (encrypted)
        Goes over the PUBLIC internet
        Requirements
            On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway (CGW)
            AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
    Direct Connect (DX)
        Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
        The connection is private, secure and fast
        Goes over a PRIVATE network
        Takes at least a month to establish

AWS Client VPN
    Connect from your computer using OpenVPN to your private network in AWS and on-premises
    Allow you to connect to your EC2 instances over a private IP (as you are in the private VPC network)
    Goes over public Internet

Transit Gateway 
    For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on -premises, star connection
    also connect with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections

AWS Architecting & Ecosystem Section


Well Architected Framework - General Guiding Principles 
    Stop guessing your capacity needs - liverage cloud scaliblity using autoscalling
    Test systems at production scale 
    Automate to make architectural experimentation easier - use serverless services
    Allow for evolutionary architectures - Design based on changing requirements 
    Drive architectures using data 
    Improve through game days - Simulate applications for flash sale days

AWS Cloud Best Practices – Design Principles
    Scalability: vertical & horizontal
    Disposable Resources: servers should be disposable & easily configured
    Automation: Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service, Auto Scaling…
    Loose Coupling:
    Services, not Servers:

Well Architected Framework 6 Pillars
1)  Operational Excellence
2)  Security
3)  Reliability
4)  Performance Efficiency
5)  Cost Optimization
6)  Sustainability


1) Operational Excellence
    Includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value
    continually improve supporting processes and procedures
    Design Principles
        Perform operations as code - Infrastructure as code
        Make frequent, small, reversible changes - So that in case of any failure, you can reverse it
        Refine operations procedures frequently - And ensure that team members are familiar with it
        Anticipate failure and Learn from all operational failures
        Use managed services - to reduce operational burden
        Implement observability for actionable insights - performance, reliability, cost…

2) Security
    Includes the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value 
    risk assessments and mitigation strategies
    Design Principles
        Shared Responsibility Model
        Automate security best practices
        Implement a strong identity foundation (ex - IAM)
            Centralize privilege management - Principle of least privilege
            reduce (or even eliminate) reliance on long-term credentials
        Enable traceability
            Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action
        Apply security at all layers
            Like edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, every instance, operating system, and application
        Protect data in transit and at rest
            Encryption, tokenization, and access control
        Keep people away from data 
            Reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data
        Prepare for security events
            Run incident response simulations
            use tools with automation increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery

3) Reliability
    Ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
    mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
    dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
    Design Principles
        Test recovery procedures
        Automatically recover from failure
        Stop guessing capacity
        Manage change in automation - Use automation to make changes to infrastructure
        Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
            Distribute requests across multiple resources to ensure that they don't share a common point of failure

4) Performance Efficiency
    Includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements
    to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
    Design Principles
        use advanced technologies as much as possible 
        Go global in minutes - Easy deployment in multiple regions
        Use serverless architectures - Avoid burden of managing servers
        Experiment more often - Easy to carry out comparative testing
        Mechanical sympathy - Be aware of all AWS services

5) Cost Optimization
    Includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
    Design Principles
        Adopt a consumption mode - Pay only for what you use
        Measure overall efficiency - Use CloudWatch
        Stop spending money on data center operations - use manage services and focus on organization projects
        Analyze and attribute expenditure - Make sure to use tags to see expanditure on that service
        Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership

6) Sustainability
    The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of runningcloud workloads.
    Design Principles
        Understand your impact – establish performance indicators, evaluate improvements
        Establish sustainability goals – Set long-term goals for each workload, model return on investment (ROI)
        Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
        Use managed services – Shared services reduce the amount of infrastructure
        Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads

AWS Right Sizing
    EC2 has many instance types, but choosing the most powerful instance type isn’t the best choice
    matching instance types and sizes that is best in performance and capacity requirements at the lowest cost
    Scaling up is easy so always start small
    at deployed instances, identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity
    It’s important to Right Size…
