The Major Branches of AI

Machine Learning (ML)
    Teaches computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
    Predicting stock prices or spam filtering
Deep Learning (DL)
    A subset of ML using neural networks to learn patterns from large datasets. 
    Image recognition, speech recognition
Natural Language Processing (NLP)   
    Allows machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language.    
    Chatbots, translation apps
Computer Vision 
    Enables computers to “see” and interpret visual data.   
    Face detection, object recognition
Robotics    
    Combines AI with hardware to perform tasks in the physical world.   
    Drones, robotic arms, autonomous vehicles
Expert Systems  
    AI programs that mimic decision-making of human experts.    
    Medical diagnosis systems


RNN ()
LLM (Large Language Modal) = A very large Transformer-based NLP model trained on massive text data.
